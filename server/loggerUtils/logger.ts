/**
 * Description of log levels:
 *
 * - TRACE: this level should be used when tracing the path of a program's execution.
 *
 * - DEBUG: any messages that may be needed for troubleshooting or diagnosing issues should be logged at this level.
 *
 * - INFO: this level should be used when capturing a typical or expected event that occurred during normal program
 *    execution, usually things that are notable from a business logic perspective.
 *
 * - WARN: log at this level when an event is unexpected but recoverable. You can also use it to indicate potential
 *    problems in the system that need to be mitigated before they become actual errors.
 *
 * - ERROR: any error that prevents normal program execution should be logged at this level. The application can
 *    usually continue to function, but the error must be addressed if it persists.
 *
 * - FATAL: use this level to log events that prevent crucial business functions from working. In situations like
 *    this, the application cannot usually recover, so immediate attention is required to fix such issues.
